# Comments

## Single Row Comments

RVL has two types of single line comments depending on the purpose.

Sometimes comment is used to exclude line of code from execution.

There is a special type of single row comments intended to put long text comments into the document.

Single row comment is displayed as long text providing that:
1. Flow is set to `#` or `//`
2. Text is completely typed into the `Type` cell.
3. Other cells after `Type` are empty.

In such case the text is displayed through the whole line:
