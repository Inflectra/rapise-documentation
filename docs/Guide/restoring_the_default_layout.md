# Restoring the Default Layout

There are two ways to restore the default layout of Rapise panes: on startup, and through the Global Settings dialog.

## On Startup

Press the ++shift++ key while opening Rapise. Keep the ++shift++ key pressed until Rapise has finished initializing.

1. Click `Settings > Global`. The **Rapise Settings** dialog will appear.
2. Navigate to the **Utilities** tab of the dialog.
3. Click the **Reset Layout** button.

Rapise will restart, and the layout will be restored to its default.
