# REST Definition Editor

![rest_definition_editor](./img/rest_definition_editor_overview.png)

## Purpose

The **REST Definition Editor** allows you to edit [REST web service](rest_web_service.md) definition files (`.rest`).

## How to Open

Use the [Add Web Service Dialog](dialog_add_web_service.md) to create a new REST definition (`.rest`) file.  The definition file will be opened in a **REST Editor** in the [Content View](content_view.md).

Or, you can double-click on an existing `.rest` file in the [Test Files View](test_files_dialog.md) explorer window. The definition file will be opened in a **REST Editor** in the [Content View](content_view.md).  The [REST Toolbar](toolbar_rest.md) is also open on the top of the editor.

## Request

The request form has several sections that you need to populate:

* **Method** - the type of HTTP request being made (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
* **URL** - the URL of the web service request with any parameter tokens included (e.g. {session_id} in our example above)
* **Credentials** - Any HTTP Basic Authentication Headers
* **Headers** - Any other HTTP headers (both standard and custom)
* **Parameters** - Any parameters that have been defined in the URL that will be called from the Rapise test script.
* **Body** - The body of the request (for POST and PUT requests). This can be in any text-serialized format such as XML or JSON.

## Response

The HTTP Response Headers are displayed:

The HTTP Response in XML format is formatted and displayed:

The HTTP Response in JSON format is formatted and displayed:

![rest_definition_editor_json](./img/rest_definition_editor6.png)

This displays the output from the last web service request. It has several tabs:

* **Response Header** - Displays a list of the HTTP response headers (name and value). If the request received a `200 OK` code back, it's displayed in green, if it receives an error code back, it's displayed in red.
* **Response Body**
*    * **Raw** - Displays the raw text of the HTTP response body received from the server.
*    * **XML** - If the received body content is identified as XML, this tab displays nicely formatted XML that is easier to read than the raw response body.
*    * **JSON** - If the received body content is identified as JSON, this tab displays nicely formatted, indented JSON that is easier to read than the raw response body.

## Operation Explorer

This section lets you add, open, delete and clone REST requests in the definition file.

* `Add request` - Adds a new REST operation to the current `.rest` definition file.

    ![Add Request](./img/rest_definition_editor_addrequest.png)

* `Clone request` - Makes a copy of the currently selected REST operation and allows you to give the copy a new name.

    ![Clone Request](./img/rest_definition_editor_clonerequest.png)

* `Delete request` - Deletes the currently selected REST operation from the current REST definition file.

## Script Steps

![REST Create Script](./img/tutorial_web_services_rest32.png)

The **REST Script Steps** tab in the bottom view lets you see the list of recorded REST operations and use them to create your [test script](scripting.md) in the main test file.

* `Create Script` - This takes all of the recorded steps and
automatically creates the matching JavaScript code in your test script.

* `Remote Step` - This removes the recorded step from the script box

* `Clean` - This removes all of the recorded steps from the script box.

> Each of the steps displayed in the script box will contain the name of the REST operation along with its HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Steps displayed in **bold\*** with an asterisk also have a [verification point recorded](checkpoints.md). That means when the script is generated, it will include a `Tester.Assert` function to verify the results.
