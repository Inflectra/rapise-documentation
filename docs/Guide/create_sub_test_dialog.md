![create sub test dialog](./img/create_sub_test_dialog1.png)

## Purpose

Create a [sub-test](tests_and_sub_tests.md).

*   **New test should have its own set of Objects**: Uncheck this option if you want to create a scenario that reuses objects from the parent test.

*   **New test should have its own User-defined functions**: Uncheck this option if you want to create a scenario that reuses utility functions from its parent test.

The sub-test is always created inside the folder of its parent test. If the parent test is saved to a new location, the sub-test is also saved in a sub-folder within the new location.

## How to Open

Choose **Create Sub-Test...** from the context menu of a folder in the [Test Files](test_files_dialog.md) view.
