# Syntax Highlighting

## Purpose

With **Syntax Highlighting**, words in a program are displayed to immediately indicate their function. Reserved words, variables, literals, and comments may be differentiated by color, boldness, underlining, or other visual cues. Syntax Highlighting makes programs easier to read and modify.

## Usage

Every JavaScript file opened in Rapise will be displayed with **Syntax Highlighting**:
