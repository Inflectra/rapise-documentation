## Purpose

The Start Page is intended to be a convenient entry point for Rapise beginners.

The Start Page provides:

1.  Links to tutorials and webinars.
2.  Links to sample tests, displaying a list of available Rapise samples. Some samples are shipped with Rapise while others are provided from the online public repository.
    *   The **Fetch Samples** button is used to download and update additional samples from the online public repository.

## How to Open

The **Start Page** opens automatically with Rapise. This behavior can be modified in the [Options](options_dialog.md) dialog using the **ShowStartPageOnStartup** setting.
