# Selenium Settings Dialog

## Selenium Profiles

Rapise can [playback web tests](cross_browser_testing.md) on Selenium nodes. Configure each Selenium node you need for testing in a separate profile using Selenium Settings Dialog.

This dialog box displays the list of Selenium Profiles and lets you create a new profile, modify a profile or make a new profile based on an existing one.

## How to Open

You can open this dialog box from the Rapise `Settings > Selenium` menu.

## Menu Options

This dialog box has the following menu options:

- **Select Profile** - This dropdown list lets you select a different Selenium profile to be displayed in the dialog.
- **Save** - This button will save the changes to the current Selenium profile.
- **Test** - This button will test the Connection (URL) from Rapise to [Selenium WebDriver](selenium_webdriver.md) (which is used to connect to the web browsers) and the connection from Selenium to the web browser.
- **Duplicate** - This button will create a new Selenium profile based on the currently viewed one.
- **Create** - This button will create a new empty Selenium profile that you can edit.
- **Rename** - This button will change the name of the current Selenium profile being edited.
- **Delete** - This button will delete the currently displayed Selenium profile. There is no undo, so be careful!

## Connection

This section lets you enter the URI used to connect to the [Selenium WebDriver](selenium_webdriver.md) server which hosts the web browsers being tested. It is typically of the form: 

```
http://server:4444/wd/hub
```
Where the port number used by Selenium is `4444` (default) and the `/wd/hub` suffix is added.

**If you are using web browsers on the local machine (that is running Rapise) you don't need to enter in a URI and can leave the entire field blank.**
