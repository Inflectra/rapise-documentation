# Spira Dashboard

In Rapise 7 we completely reworked the Spira Dashboard. It has all new look and features. New dashboard reduces the need to open Spira in a browser window and also adds support for Flaky test handling, Rerun features and ability to run a test case/whole test set/or just failed test cases on a selected automation host.

## New Features

If you are not familiar with the dashboard and it's basic features it is recommended to review [Navigation](#navigation) and [Tasks](#tasks) sections first.

### Flaky Tests

If you see that some test may pass or fail randomly there is a way to mark it as Flaky. Simply find it in [Test Cases View](#test-cases-view) and use [Actions menu](#actions) to set the flag. Flaky test case is decorated with an icon (red flag):

<img alt="Flaky Test Case" src="/Guide/img/spira_dashboard_flaky_test_case.png" width="300"/> 

When a test case marked as Flaky is executed - it's test run is marked as Flaky too.

!!! note
	Flaky flag makes it easier to distinguish random and important test run failures.

### Automatic Rerun

To instruct RapiseLauncher to rerun a failed test case use `Max rerun attempts` test set custom property. If a test case keeps failing it will be additionally executed specified number of times (by default it is zero). To stop rerunning tests if many of them finally failed use `Do not rerun if N tests failed` property. By default this property is zero and it means rerun all the tests in a test set if `Max rerun attempts` is set.

Test runs that correspond to reruns are decorated with icons. Number in a circle designates rerun attempt. 

<img alt="Reruns" src="/Guide/img/spira_dashboard_rerun_test_runs.png" width="350"/>

### Parallel Execution

Since Rapise 7.1 - RapiseLauncher is able to perform parallel run for these types of tests:

1. Web tests configured to run with Selenium WebDriver,
2. Mobile tests,
3. REST/SOAP API tests.

In order to mark a test case ready for parallel run set the custom property `Ready for parallel run` in test case details.

<img alt="Test Case Properties" src="/Guide/img/test-case-custom-properties.png" width="360"/>

If all test cases included into a test set have this property, the test set is configured for parallel run - RapiseLauncher will execute the test cases in parallel.

To configure the test set use the custom properties `Run tests in parallel` and `Max parallel tests` (0 - no limit).

### Input Data Table

Since Rapise 7.1 you may define a table with parameter values to automatically run same test set with different input data. It is an alternative to [test configurations](https://www.inflectra.com/ideas/Entry/spotlight-on-spiratest-53--data-driven-testing-wit-495.aspx).

1. Create a CSV or TXT file with parameter names and values. You may do it right from the dashboard (navigate to test set details and use Create New popup menu in the Attachments section). Example of the data file:

	```
	UserName,Password
	librarian,librarian
	borrower,borrower
	```

2. Choose this attachment in the `Input data` custom property.

RapiseLauncher will run the test set same number of times as data rows in the input file. Every column name will become a global parameter passed to a test case.

## How to Open

To open the dashboard use [main menu](/Guide/menu_and_toolbars/#view) View > Spira Dashboard. If you wish Rapise to open the dashboard automatically on startup - open the [Rapise Settings](/Guide/options_dialog/#settings) dialog and set `ShowDashboardOnStartup` flag to `true`.

## Navigation

The dashboard contains top level menu to switch between views and a dropdown to switch between products/projects. There is also a button to refresh data and search field to filter data in the current view. Filtering is applied to a column with orange caption (usually `Name`).

![Dashboard Main Menu](./img/spira_dashboard_toplevel_menu.png)

### Data Tables

In many cases first column of a data table contains ID of an item in Spira. You may click an ID to open the corresponding item in a browser window.

![Data Table](./img/spira_dashboard_data_table.png)

Each data table has a menu opener (hamburger) located in the top right corner. The menu contains some predefined filters and also allows to reveal filter row and choose what columns to show. Clicking a column caption turns on sorting.

### Hierarchical Tables

Plus icon in a table row means that it can be expanded. Click the icon to reveal row details. It may contain more data tables.

### Tree View

Test cases and test sets may be placed into folders in Spira. The dashboard loads folder hierarchy. To navigate it click on folder icons.

<img alt="Folder Tree" src="/Guide/img/spira_dashboard_tree.png" width="386"/>

### Actions

Some tables include `Action` column. It allows the user to perform certain actions on an item displayed in the row where `Action` menu is expanded.

## Tasks

Here is the list of tasks you may accomplish with the dashboard.

### Connect To Spira

If you did not connect Rapise to Spira yet, you will be prompted to enter the connection info.

<img alt="No Connection" src="/Guide/img/spira_dashboard_connection.png" width="450"/>

To get your API Key follow [these steps](https://spiradoc.inflectra.com/HowTo-Guides/Users-profile-management/#how-to-get-or-make-your-rss-token-or-api-key).

### Assign Automation Host Token

If you did not assign an automation host token to the machine where Rapise is running you may do it in Automation Hosts view. You may even create a new host there.

![Automation Hosts](./img/spira_dashboard_automation_hosts.png)

### Dashboard View

#### Browse Framework Tests

The dashboard view shows tests included in the currently opened test framework (parent test and it's sub-tests).

#### View Test Runs in Progress

View test runs that are in progress right now.

#### View Pending Test Runs for This Host

View tests that are scheduled to run on the local host for the next 24 hours.

#### Setup Custom Properties

Some features of the dashboard require additional custom properties to exist in Test Cases, Test Sets and Test Runs. Click `Create Custom Properties for Rapise` button to add the following custom properties in the selected project:

- Test Cases
	- Flaky (boolean, default is false)
	- Ready for parallel run (boolean, default is false, requires Rapise 7.1+)
- Test Runs
	- Flaky (boolean, default is false)
	- Run attempt (integer, default is 1)
	- Tag (string, empty by default, requires Rapise 7.1+)
- Test Sets
	- Max rerun attempts (integer, default is 0)
	- Do not rerun if N tests failed (integer, default is 0)
	- Rerun test set if failed (boolean, default is false, requires Rapise 7.1+)
	- Run tests in parallel (boolean, default is false, requires Rapise 7.1+)
	- Max parallel tests (integer, default is 0 (no limit), requires Rapise 7.1+)
	- Input data (string, empty by default, requires Rapise 7.1+)
	- Record videos (boolean, default is false)
	- Verbose level (integer, default is 1)
	- [GitUrl, GitUser, GitPassword, GitBranch, GitRoot](/Guide/git_integration/#using-spira-custom-properties) (string, empty by default)

Clicking the button more than once is safe. If a custom property exists - Rapise won't create a duplicate. To create the custom properties you will need to enter administrator credentials (user name and API Key).

#### Perform Test Actions

Action menu for a test allows to

1. Open the test in Rapise
2. Link the test to a test case in Spira
3. Execute the test (if linked to a test case) via RapiseLauncher on the local machine or a selected automation host. Requires Rapise 7.1+.

### Pending Test Runs View
