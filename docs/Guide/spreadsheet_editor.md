# Spreadsheet Editor

## Purpose

The Spreadsheet editor lets you view and edit Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files (.xls or .xlsx). This very convenient when you are doing [data-driven testing](data_driven_testing.md) and need to create or edit the test data directly inside Rapise.

## How to Open

Use the [Test Files View](test_files_dialog.md) to open an Excel file.  The Excel file will be opened in a **Spreadsheet Viewer,** in the [Content View](content_view.md).  The [Spreadsheet](toolbar_spreadsheet.md) tab of the Ribbon will also open.

## Formula Bar

The formula bar lets you see/edit the contents of the currently selected cell as well as enter more complex Excel calculations/formulas:

## Encrypting a Cell

There might be occasions when you need your XLS files to hold sensitive information (like passwords). In such scenarios, you have the convenience of encrypting these values. Later, you can decrypt them using [Global.DoDecrypt](../Libraries/Global.md#dodecrypt) prior to using them as function parameters.

## Spreadsheet Grid

The main spreadsheet grid lets you see the cells in the spreadsheet, select a range and use the [Spreadsheet ribbon](toolbar_spreadsheet.md) to change the format:

## Cell Formatting

By default all cells have General format. It means that format of a cell value is determined automatically during read operation. It may lead to undesired effects. For example, if a cell contains date `5/1/2020`, the value read will be `43952`. If you want to get cell value in text format you may change the format to Text using **Format Cells** dialog.

Then you need to re-enter the date. After that Rapise will read the date exactly as `5/1/2020`.
