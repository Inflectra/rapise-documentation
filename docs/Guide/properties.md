# Properties View

![properties dialog](./img/properties1.png)

## Purpose

Displays the properties of the last-clicked object, file, or folder. Objects are in the [Object Tree View](object_tree.md) and files/folders are in the [Test Files View](test_files_dialog.md).

Some properties are too long to fit into the editor field. Therefore, you can use the `...` button:

![properties dialog](./img/properties2.png)

to open the **Value Editor**:

![properties dialog](./img/properties3.png)

## How to Open

The **Properties** Dialog is part of the [Default Layout](restoring_the_default_layout.md).
