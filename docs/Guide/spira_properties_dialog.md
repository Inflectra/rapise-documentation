## Purpose

This dialog shows you the [SpiraTest / SpiraTeam test case](spiratest_integration.md) associated with the current Rapise test script.

## How to Open

Use the menu 'Test > Spira Properties'.

The dialog box will list the following:

- **Spira Project** - Displays the name of the SpiraTest project where the test script is saved.
- **Test Folder** - Displays the name of the folder containing the linked SpiraTest test case.
- **Test Case** - Displays the name of the SpiraTest test case to which the test script is linked.

To unlink the current test script from SpiraTest (for example, to save it to a different SpiraTest project), click the **Unlink from Test Case** button.

If your test framework includes sub-tests and you want to unlink all of them from SpiraTest, click the **Unlink Test and Sub-Tests from Test Cases** button.
