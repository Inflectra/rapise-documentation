## Purpose

The purpose of this dialog is to allow you to show you the [SpiraTest / SpiraTeam test case](spiratest_integration.md) that the current Rapise test script is associated with.

## How to Open

Use the menu 'Test > Spira Properties'.

The dialog box will list the following:

- **Spira Project** - this displays the name of the project in SpiraTest that the test script is saved in
- **Test Folder** - this displays the name of the folder that the linked SpiraTest test case is contained in
- **Test Case** - this displays the name of the test case in SpiraTest that the test script is linked to

If you want to unlink the current test script from SpiraTest (for example to save to a different SpiraTest project), click on the **Unlink from Test Case** button.

If you have a test framework with sub-tests and you want to unlink all from SpiraTest, click on the **Unlink Test and Sub-Tests from Test Cases** button.
