![enter filter criteria dialog,condition](./img/enter_filter_criteria_for____d3.png)

You can specify any number of conditions. Each condition has two properties: a **Matching Criteria** on the left and a **filter value** on the right. The **filter value** is a string, and the **matching criteria** specifies what constitutes a match. For more details, refer to [HERE](report_filtering.md).

## Filter Aggregation

You can aggregate or combine filter conditions in two ways:

- **All**: All conditions must be true for a match to occur.
- **Any**: At least one condition must be true for a match to occur.

## Buttons
