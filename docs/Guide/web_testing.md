# Web Testing

## Purpose

Rapise lets you record and play automated tests against web applications on a variety of web browsers including **Google Chrome**, **Microsoft Edge**, **Mozilla Firefox**, **Internet Explorer** and **Safari**. Rapise lets you record or create your tests against one browser and then play the same test back against all of the other browsers. It is called **Cross Browser Testing**.

Rapise provides comprehensive support for testing Web applications. It uses the web browser Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with the current web page. The various web browsers on the market have various differences in DOM implementation. In many cases these differences are not significant. But sometimes they require special handling. Rapise tries to overcome the differences and make the recorded scripts as universal as possible.

In addition, it is possible to have more control over the cross browser execution using the available APIs and configuration variables. You can also run the recording in multiple browsers in succession using either a Rapise [sub-test](tests_and_sub_tests.md) or simply executing the test from our [SpiraTest test management](spiratest_integration.md) system and passing through different parameter values.

## DOM API

In addition to the usual [recording](recording.md), [learning](learn_object.md) and [playback](playback.md) that is similar to testing other technologies (desktop, mobile, etc.) there are some unique functions that are available on all recorded web objects. Upon learning a web element in Rapise, you get an object of type [HTMLObject](/Libraries/HTMLObject/). Each **HTMLObject** provides set of functions to facilitate the cross-browser access to web element parents and children.

- **DoDOMChildAt** - Returns n-th child (zero-based).
- **DoDOMChildrenCount** - Returns number of children elements for this one.
- **DoDOMFindParentWithAttribute** - Returns parent element with given attribute matching given string or regex.
- **DoDOMGetAttribute** - Returns specified attribute.
- **DoDOMNextSibling** - Returns next sibling element for this one.
- **DoDOMParent** - Returns parent element having this element.
- **DoDOMPrevSibling** - Return previous sibling element for this one.
- **DoDOMRoot** - Returns Root element having this element.
