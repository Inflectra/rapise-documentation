# Object Libraries

## Purpose

**Object libraries** define what objects and interactions Rapise understands during [Recording](recording.md) and [Learning](object_learning.md). Â Most Object Libraries are specific to an application or a set of applications.

## Usage

Rapise comes with many different object libraries. See the list of libraries and supported control types below.

> **Note:** Selecting **Auto** as the application recording library will cause Rapise to select the one that it deems is most appropriate.

> **Note:** You can [add your own](custom_libraries.md) Recording library - one that understands the objects in your application.
