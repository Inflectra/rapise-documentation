# Breakpoints

## Purpose

**Breakpoints** stop execution of the test at a specific line in the script. They allow you to investigate program state, and trace execution flow.

## Usage

To set a **Breakpoint**:

1. Open the script you would like to debug in the [Source Editor](source_editor.md).
2. Place the cursor at the line where you want a breakpoint.
3. Press **F9** or click on the gray strip to the left of line numbers.

## Viewing and Removing Breakpoints

Once you need to view all breakpoints, while in [Source Editor](source_editor.md), choose `Edit > Show All Breakpoints`.

If you need to get rid from all breakpoints, choose `Edit > Remove All Breakpoints`.
