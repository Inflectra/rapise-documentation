## Features

Rapise offers many features. These features are designed to simplify all aspects of test automation.
Most Rapise features fall into one of five categories:

1. Building test scripts with little or no manual scripting.
2. Reading and interpreting results and reports.
3. Additional features and capabilities for sophisticated testing.
4. Writing more involved or complex tests using scripting.
5. Extending Rapise to learn new or extended libraries of capabilities. Depending on the application set being tested, not all of these features may be necessary for every situation.

For each feature, this document presents:

1. The reason for using a given feature.
2. A summary of the basic value of the feature.
3. An overview of how the feature works from a user's perspective.
4. At least one useful sample demonstrating how to use the feature.
