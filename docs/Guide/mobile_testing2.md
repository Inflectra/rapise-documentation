# Mobile Testing

## Purpose

Rapise lets you record and play automated tests against native applications on a variety of mobile devices using either [Apple iOS](mobile_testing_ios.md) or [Android](mobile_testing_android.md). Rapise gives you the flexibility to test your applications on either real or simulated devices.

## Usage

Since the process for testing mobile devices depends heavily on the platform being used, we have split the guide into four separate sections:

- [Preparing Environment for iOS Mobile Testing](/Manuals/Preparing_for_iOS_Testing/)
- [Mobile Testing using iOS](mobile_testing_ios.md)
- [Preparing Environment for Android Mobile Testing](/Manuals/Preparing_for_Android_Testing/)
- [Mobile Testing using Android](mobile_testing_android.md)

## Samples

You can find the mobile sample tests and sample Applications (called AUTAndroid for Android and AUTiOS for Apple iOS) at the following locations:

- [AUTAndroid Repository](https://github.com/Inflectra/AUTAndroid)
- [AUTiOS Repository](https://github.com/Inflectra/AUTiOS)

## See Also

- [Mobile Settings Dialog](mobile_settings_dialog.md) - for information on setting up the different **mobile profiles** for the mobile devices you will be testing.
- [Mobile Object Spy](object_spy_mobile.md) - for information on how Rapise connects to the device and lets you view the objects in the tested application.
