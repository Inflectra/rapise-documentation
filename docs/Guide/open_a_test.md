# Open a Test

You can open a test from the main menu.

The main menu has an **Open** option, and a list of **Recent Tests** from which you may choose:

You can also open a test that is stored in **SpiraTest** (our web-based test management system) instead of the local filesystem. This is done by clicking on the **Open Test from Spira** option instead. More details on using Rapise with SpiraTest can be found in the [SpiraTest Integration](spiratest_integration.md) section.
