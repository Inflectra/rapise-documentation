# Microsoft Dynamics

## Overview

Microsoft Dynamics is a line of **enterprise resource planning (ERP)** and **customer relationship management (CRM)** software applications from Microsoft. The focus industries for Microsoft Dynamics are retail, service, manufacturing, financial services, and the public sector. Microsoft Dynamics offers support for small, medium, and large businesses.

Microsoft **Dynamics ERP** comprises a group of enterprise-resource-planning products primarily geared toward midsize organizations with simple corporate structures and low-to-moderately complex production models. Microsoft Dynamics ERP includes three primary products:

- **Microsoft Dynamics AX** (formerly Axapta) - multi-language, multi-currency enterprise resource planning (ERP) business software with global business management features for financial, human resources, and operations management, as well as additional industry capabilities for retailers, professional service industries, financial service businesses, manufacturers, and public-sector organizations.
- **Microsoft Dynamics GP** (formerly Great Plains Software) - ERP software for small and midsize businesses that helps manage financials, supply chain, and employees.
- **Microsoft Dynamics NAV** (formerly Navision) - business management solution that helps small and and midsize businesses manage their financials, supply chain, and employees. It features multiple languages and multiple currencies.

**Microsoft Dynamics CRM** is a customer relationship management application from Microsoft that provides sales, service, and marketing capabilities. Microsoft sells Microsoft Dynamics CRM separately from the ERP products. CRM is available either as on-premises software or as a software-as-a-service offering called **Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online**.

Starting in late 2016, Microsoft created a new cloud-based SaaS-only combined ERP/CRM solution called **Microsoft Dynamics 365**. This provides a new web-based version of Dynamics AX (renamed Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations), and a new web-based version of Dynamics NAV (called Dynamics 365 Business Central), and an updated version of Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online (Dynamics 365 for Sales). This new integrated ERP/CRM is available solely through Microsoft Azure and is completely web-based.
