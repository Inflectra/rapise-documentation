# Tooltips

## Purpose

**Tooltips** let you view a variable's value during debugging.

## Usage

1.  Set a breakpoint in the script at or near the point you wish to investigate.
2.  Hover over variables as you step through the script. A small box will pop up, displaying the variable's value:
