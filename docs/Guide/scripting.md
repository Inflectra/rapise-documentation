# Scripting

## Purpose

There are three reasons to script with Rapise:

1. To modify a [recorded](recording.md) test to increase coverage, add [assert statements](assertions.md), or make the test [data-driven](data_driven_testing.md).
2. To extend recording functionality by defining your own objects, actions, and libraries.
3. To [customize the Rapise Engine](customizable_engine.md).

## Usage

Rapise scripts are written in JavaScript (NodeJS or Microsoft JScript, depending on [settings](options_dialog.md#execution)). You can run and debug your script using the full featured [Internal Debugger](internal_debugger.md). Rapise includes a testing API, with methods for manipulating images, spreadsheets, common GUI widgets, and more.
