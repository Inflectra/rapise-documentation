# Unit Testing

## Purpose

**Unit Testing** involves testing individual units of a piece of software to ensure they behave as intended. These units are typically functions or class methods.

## Usage

There are five ways that Rapise can assist with unit testing:

1.  Rapise methods support testing objects and methods in [DLLs](dll_testing.md).
2.  Rapise can test **ActiveX** objects and their methods through their [COM Interface](com_testing_support.md).
3.  If you choose to write your unit tests in a third-party tool, Rapise has a [Command Line](command_line.md) interface to access its functionality.
4.  Test results are written to a [TAP](tap.md) file, which allows integration with unit testing frameworks.
5.  Rapise tests can be invoked from [Visual Studio MS-Test, VSTS](visual_studio.md) and [NUnit](nunit.md).
