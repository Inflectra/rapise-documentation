# New in Rapise 9.0 (February 2026)

!!! info "Summary"
    - :material-robot-happy-outline: AI-based self-healing for Web tests [IN:12237]

		Rapise 9.0 takes the self-healing capabilities of Web testing to the next level. This version introduces the concept of SmartAction, which includes both the object description and the action intent expressed in human language. Though SmartAction is automatically recorded and translated to a working, cached standard Rapise action, it uses its embedded intelligence to automatically heal the underlying object locator in case of application updates. This is just the first step we are taking for 9.0; next 9.x versions will contain many more features built around SmartActions and AI. :rocket:
