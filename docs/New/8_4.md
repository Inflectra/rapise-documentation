# New in Rapise 8.4 (April 2025)

!!! info "Summary"
    - [Test Set Orchestration](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB893.aspx) [IN:10931]

		Rapise 8.4 introduces an easy method to **run** multiple test sets and **rerun** failed test sets across multiple products. To leverage these features, integrate the [TestRunner module](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB893.aspx) into your framework. With **TestRunner**, you can also do **AI-powered** **root cause analysis** of failed test cases, **analyze historical data** of test case runs and generate reports in **PDF format**, and more.

		[Dynamic Test Sets](../Guide/dynamic_test_sets.md) provide a powerful way to **execute targeted tests based on specific criteria**. This feature allows you to include test cases into a test set using properties like **name**, **fully qualified name**, **tags**, and **parameters**. This approach helps to focus on specific testing scenarios without needing to manually select test cases. This functionality mirrors filtering capabilities found in tools like **Microsoft VSTest**, making it familiar for users accustomed to that environment.

    - UI Improvements [IN:10932]

		The **Quick Filter** in **Rapise** offers a fast and intuitive way to narrow down visible items in the [Object Tree](../Guide/object_tree.md#filtering) or [Test Files](../Guide/test_files_dialog.md#filtering) by entering a keyword or search term. It's especially helpful when working with large, complex [test frameworks](../Guide/Frameworks/frameworks.md).

		The [RVL Editor](https://rapisedoc.inflectra.com/Guide/rvl_editor/) now supports **drag-and-drop reordering of RVL tabs**, making it easier to organize sheets within your **Test Cases** and **RVL-based Page Objects**.
