# New in Rapise 8.6 (October 2025)

!!! info "Summary"
    - Added support for **Inflectra.ai**: The Embedded Generative AI Engine for Scalable, Secure Software Delivery [IN:11667]

		[Inflectra.ai](https://inflectra.ai) is now available as a Generative AI provider in Rapise, offering an embedded and secure engine for quality delivery. This integration allows users with Spira and Inflectra.ai enabled to generate [data, test scenarios](../Guide/ai_dashboard.md#chats) and [code](../RVL/AI.md) directly within Rapise. It simplifies the process by removing the need for separate accounts with external AI providers. The AI is context-aware, understanding Rapise's APIs, the testing framework, and object repositories to generate precise and specialized code. This streamlined workflow enhances efficiency and maintains security, as all AI interactions are managed within the Inflectra ecosystem.
