# New in Rapise 8.5 (July 2025)

!!! info "Summary"
    - [:penguin: Enable Spira-driven execution of Web and API tests on Linux/macOS/Docker](../Intro/devops.md#linux-macos-docker) [IN:11349]

		Rapise 8.5 takes a major step forward in **cross-platform** test execution. You can now run **Web** and **API** tests in any environment that supports Node.js. This version introduces the new Node.js-based **RapiseLauncher**, which performs test execution on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Docker**, and reports the results directly to **Spira**. These enhancements lead to more cost-effective testing and provide greater flexibility for CI/CD integration with platforms like **AWS CodeBuild**, **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Jenkins**.

    - :rocket: Optimize Rapise to support 30k test cases in a framework [IN:11350]

		To better support **large testing frameworks**, we have **optimized** Rapise to ensure a **smooth user experience**. These performance enhancements are designed for enterprise level testing frameworks that have grown significantly, providing reliable operation for projects containing up to **30,000** test cases.
