# Training

We can train your QA team to effectively use Rapise for UI test automation. If you are switching from manual testing it is a highly recommended option for you. Please contact sales@inflectra.com to arrange.

Training may be a part of [Rapise Quick-Start implementation package](https://www.inflectra.com/Company/Article/jump-starting-your-rapise-test-automation-project-997.aspx).

## Overview

The proposed training is an interactive process. Our instructors both provide online sessions and give lab tasks to check the level of understanding of participants. 

The implementation of lab tasks by the participants requires them to have the necessary prerequisites (have a computer available, Rapise is installed and licensed on the computer, have access to training SpiraTest instance and have certain amount of time to attend sessions and complete lab tasks).

We provide sessions via Zoom. The length of each session is about 1 hour. Each session starts from review of lab tasks assigned in the previous session and comments about any common issues. Also it contains a Q&A section for questions asked in the previous session. Then at the end of the session there is another Q&A section where instructors collect new questions: some questions are answered immediately and others are answered in the next session.

We expect that participants deliver lab results at the end of the day following the day of a session and then the next day our instructors check the completed lab tasks. This process allows to have two sessions per week.

## Prerequisites

Each person attending training should have:

- Individual PC with Rapise installed
- Access to training SpiraTest instance
- Access to demo applications
