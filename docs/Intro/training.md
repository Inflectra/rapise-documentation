# Training

We can train your QA team to use Rapise effectively for UI test automation. If you are switching from manual testing, this is a highly recommended option. Please contact sales@inflectra.com to make arrangements.

Training can be part of the [Rapise Quick-Start implementation package](https://www.inflectra.com/Company/Article/jump-starting-your-rapise-test-automation-project-997.aspx).

## Overview

The training is an interactive process. Our instructors provide online sessions and assign lab tasks to check the participants' level of understanding.

To complete the lab tasks, participants must have the necessary prerequisites: a computer with Rapise installed and licensed, access to the training SpiraTest instance, and enough time to attend sessions and complete the tasks.

Sessions are conducted via Zoom. Each session lasts about one hour. Each session starts with a review of the lab tasks from the previous session and a discussion of any common issues. It also includes a Q&A section to address questions from the previous session. At the end of the session, there is another Q&A section where instructors take new questions. Some questions are answered immediately, while others are addressed in the next session.

We expect participants to submit their lab results by the end of the day following a session. Our instructors will then check the completed lab tasks on the following day. This process allows for two sessions per week.

## Prerequisites

Each person attending the training should have:

- An individual PC with Rapise installed
- Access to the training SpiraTest instance
