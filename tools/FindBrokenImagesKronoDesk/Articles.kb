Some applications assign dynamic IDs to elements, some use ARIA attributes and some do not, some values of class attribute have meaning related to element position and some just used for styling . There are also cases when an app contains hidden DOM layers which stack on top of each other. So usage of same set of attributes for generating XPath is not efficient and may lead to weak locators that break after application reloading or slight modification. To cope with these problems Rapise introduces Web App Profile. It is a simple JSON file of a defined structure that instructs Rapise how to build XPath for elements in a particular application. From this article you will learn how to define a profile for your web application."},

This statement is also true for Rapise objects. A common requirement is to deal with the same objects within a flow of different test cases. For instance, if an application has “Log In” functionality then many, many tests will require logging-in and logging-out. Each test will have this object in its own object tree. However this causes trouble if a change in the application affects the recognition of the Log In object. All of the test cases will need to be updated. In such situations it is much more convenient to have the “Log In” objects placed into their own file and re-used by other tests."},
